### Sites with limited number of free articles
The free article limit can normally be bypassed by removing cookies for the site.*

Install the Cookie Remover extension [for Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cookie-remover/kcgpggonjhmeaejebeoeomdlohicfhce) or [for Mozilla Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookie-remover/). Please rate it 5 stars if you find it useful.

When coming across a paywall click the cookie icon to remove the cookies then refresh the page.

_*May not always succeed_

### New site requests
Only large or major sites will be considered. Usually premium articles cannot be bypassed as they are behind a hard paywall.

1. Install the uBlock Origin extension if it hasn't been installed already. See if you are still getting a paywall.
2. Check if using Cookie Remover ([Google Chrome version](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cookie-remover/kcgpggonjhmeaejebeoeomdlohicfhce) or [Mozilla Firefox version](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookie-remover/)) can bypass the paywall. If not, continue to the next step.
3. First search [Issues](https://github.com/iamadamdev/bypass-paywalls-chrome/issues) to see if the site has been requested already.
4. Visit an article on the site you want to bypass the paywall for and copy the article title.
5. Open up a new incognito window (Ctrl+Shift+N on Chrome) or Private window (Ctrl+Shift+P on Firefox), and paste the article title into Google.
6. Click on the same article from the Google search results page.
7. If it loads without a paywall you can [submit a request](https://github.com/iamadamdev/bypass-paywalls-chrome/issues/new/choose) and replace the entire template text with the word "Confirmed". Otherwise please do not submit an issue as this extension cannot bypass it either.

### Troubleshooting
* This extension works best alongside uBlock Origin [for Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm) or [for Mozilla Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/).
* If a site doesn't work, try turning off uBlock and refreshing.
* Try clearing [cookies](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cookie-remover/kcgpggonjhmeaejebeoeomdlohicfhce).
* Make sure you're running the latest version of Bypass Paywalls.
* If a site is having problems try unchecking "\*General Paywall Bypass\*" in Options.
* If none of these work, you can submit an issue [here](https://github.com/iamadamdev/bypass-paywalls-chrome/issues/new/choose).

### Contributing - Pull Requests
PRs are welcome. 
1. If making a PR to add a new site, confirm your changes actually bypass the paywall.
2. At a minimum these files need to be updated: `README.md`, `manifest-ff.json`, `src/js/sites.js`, and possibly `src/js/background.js`, and/or `src/js/contentScript.js`.
3. Follow existing code-style and use camelCase.
4. Use [JavaScript Semi-Standard Style linter](https://github.com/standard/semistandard). Don't need to follow it exactly. There will be some errors (e.g., do not use it on `sites.js`).
